<P>The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture comes with a kernel API & library API. 
This document describes the library API and how it interfaces with the kernel 
API.  The kernal API will probably never be documented in standalone form.</P>
<P>Application programmers should use the library API rather than kernel API.
The Library offers 100% of the functionally of the kernel API, but add next
major improvements in usability, making the application code simpler and
better looking. In addition, some of the some fixes/compatibility code in,
may be placed in the library code instead of the kernel driver.</P>
<P>For a complete list of all variables and functions in the API you should look
at the following header files:
<OL>
<LI>/usr/include/sys/soundlib.h</LI>
<LI>/usr/include/linux/sound.h</LI>
<LI>/usr/include/linux/sounddetect.h</LI>
</OL>
